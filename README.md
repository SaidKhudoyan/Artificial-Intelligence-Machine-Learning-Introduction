Together with the TU Vienna and JKU Linz I created the course for bachelors students of computer science. However, most/all materials, including lectures were made available as a MOOC course for everyone who wants to learn more about AI.

As a result of our hard work, more than 300 people have already registered to the course. If you too are interested, feel free to join the course at https://imoox.at/course/AI-einformatics and give us feedback.
